This project is designed for new and casual Formula One fans. The goal of the project is to help improve the understanding of the sport by defining some of the sports most commonly used terms, the project will display the terms in categories based on where they are in the alphabet, user will be able to add new definitions aswell as editing existing definitions if needed.

## UX

### User Goals

I expect that the majority of the users will fall into the following criteria:

- Be a Formula One Fan.
- A user with very little Formula One knowledge looking to learn.
- A user with lots of Formula One knowledge looking to update and add new definitions to the site.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want the site to be simple to use and visually appealing.
- As a user, I want the the definitions to be sorted in categories.
- As a user, I want to be able to update any incorrect definitions.
- As a user, I want to be able to add more definitions to the site.
- As a user, I want to be able to quickly find the information I am looking for.

### Wireframes

[Here](https://github.com/filleben/F1Dictionary/tree/master/wireframes) are the designs I made for the site.

The wireframes were made using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud)

### Design Choices

- **Font**: I wanted the project to look as professional as possible so decided to use a copy of the official Formula One font sourced from [Here](https://www.ffonts.net/Formula1-Display-Regular.font.download).

- **Colours**: I wanted the project to look like a product from Formula One so with this in mind I used the same colour scheme used on the [Official Site](https://www.formula1.com/). I used white (Hex: '#ffffff' RGB: 'rgb(255, 255, 255)') as the background and navbar font colour, red (Hex: '#ff0000' RGB: 'rgb(255, 0, 0)') for the navbar and block-divder elements and then black (Hex: '#000000' RGB: 'rgb(0, 0, 0)') for the body text.
