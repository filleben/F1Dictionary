## UX

### User Goals

I expect that the majority of the users will fall into the following criteria:

- Be a Formula One Fan.
- A user with very little Formula One knowledge looking to learn.
- A user with lots of Formula One knowledge looking to update and add new definitions to the site.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want the site to be simple to use and visually appealing.
- As a user, I want the the definitions to be sorted in categories.
- As a user, I want to be able to update any incorrect definitions.
- As a user, I want to be able to add more definitions to the site.
- As a user, I want to be able to quickly find the information I am looking for.
